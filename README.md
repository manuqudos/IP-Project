## Description
{This is a portfolio application. Its purpose is to highlight the past varied projects within my portfolio. The aim is to give prospective employers and clients a chance to see the kind of work that I do as far as web applications are concerned. }
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This is a great place
* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Known Bugs
{Still tring to work on the styling of the page. }
## Technologies Used
{The languages and tools used to create this app are HTML, CSS, Atom and JavaScript. By using HTML, I have been able to come up with a basic webpage.}
## Support and contact details
{In case of any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns, feel free to contact me or make a contribution to the code.}
